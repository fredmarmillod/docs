Our API uses bearer token authentication to validate user requests. This guide will walk you through the process of creating an API token and how to include it in the request header for successful authentication.

## Create an API Token

To begin using our API, you need to generate an API token. Follow the steps below to create a new token:

- Navigate to the [API Tokens](https://pdf-api.io/app/api-tokens) page.
- Click on the "Create a token" button.
- Provide a name for your token.
- Submit the form to generate the token.

## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
