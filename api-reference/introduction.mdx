Our API uses bearer token authentication to validate user requests. This guide will walk you through the process of creating an API token and how to include it in the request header for successful authentication.

## Create an API Token

To begin using our API, you need to generate an API token. Follow the steps below to create a new token:

- Navigate to the [API Tokens](https://pdf-api.io/app/api-tokens) page.
- Click on the "Create a token" button.
- Provide a name for your token.
- Submit the form to generate the token.

<Note>
  Upon generating the token, copy it immediately and store it in a secure location. For security reasons, you will not be able to view this token again.
</Note>

## Include the Token in the Request Header

Once you have your API token, you must include it in the request header to access our API's endpoints. Here's how you can add the token to the header using curl:

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
